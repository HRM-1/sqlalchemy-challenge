Challenge Module 10
This code delves into Hawaii's climate using two datasets: one capturing temperature and precipitation details, and the other providing information about measurement stations. The analysis encompasses a comprehensive exploration, revealing the count of observations by station, descriptive statistics, and extreme temperatures such as maximum and minimum values. To enhance accessibility, an API has been crafted, empowering users to request JSON files housing the insights derived from the analysis.
